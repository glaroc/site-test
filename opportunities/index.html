        <h2 id="post-doctoral-position-in-artificial-intelligence-for-biodiversity-monitoring">Post-doctoral position in Artificial Intelligence for biodiversity monitoring</h2>
<p>The Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences (QCBS; <a href="http://qcbs.ca/">http://qcbs.ca/</a>)
and the Department of Biological Sciences at Université de Montréal
(UdeM) are seeking applications for a post-doctoral fellow in artificial
intelligence applied to biodiversity monitoring. QCBS is now hosting
the secretariat of GEO BON (<a href="https://geobon.org/)">https://geobon.org/)</a>. One of the thematics
developed in this secretariat will be the integration of machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and data science in service to the monitoring and
forecasting of Earth’s biodiversity. Review of application materials will
start immediately and will continue until the position is filled. Due to the
current working conditions, we expect the selected candidate to start working
remotely, but will eventually be physically present at the University. The
position is open for an initial duration of a year with an annual salary of
ca. 50 000 CAD (an additional grant is available for applicants targeted by
EDI programs or members of URM), including benefits and membership in UdeM
research personnel union (SÉRUM).</p>
<h3 id="tasks-responsibilities-and-opportunities">Tasks, responsibilities, and opportunities</h3>
<ul>
<li>work in close collaboration with partners from the AI and digital sustainability communities, including Future Earth, Microsoft Research AI for Earth, IVADO (U. de Montréal data science institute), Element AI, Calcul Québec, and the MILA, and stakeholders from the provincial government</li>
<li>contribute to and develop research projects relying on the use of data science tools, with a specific focus on forecasting methods, including but not limited to data synthesis, probabilistic programming, deep learning, image recognition, and other predictive methods</li>
<li>dedicate between half a day and a day per week to consult with graduate students and post-doctoral fellows on quantitative and computational techniques, and provide feedback on existing projects</li>
<li>contribute to enriching the QCBS training offer by co-developing short training modules on AI/ML for graduate students, in collaboration with existing efforts with IVADO</li>
<li>dedicate no more than half a day a month to collating information about the use and outcomes of AI/ML applications by QCBS members, to be used for the centre’s reporting to funding agencies</li>
<li>have access to free professional development including (but not limited to) advanced classes given by the NSERC BIOS² program (<a href="http://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/),">http://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/),</a> the NSERC Living Data Project program, as well as free training initiatives led by IVADO (<a href="https://ivado.ca/en/trainings/),">https://ivado.ca/en/trainings/),</a> and Calcul Québec (<a href="https://www.calculquebec.ca/en/academic-research-services/training/">https://www.calculquebec.ca/en/academic-research-services/training/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The position will be hosted at the new UdeM campus, in newly renovated
office space that UdeM pledged for GEO BON activities. It is expected that
the candidate will have to visit the Institut de Recherche en Biologie
Végétale, as well as the QCBS head office at McGill University. The
selected applicant will be given the opportunity to work with a high degree
of autonomy and will be encouraged to carve out new partnerships and research
collaborations. Remote work is expected for the first months of the position
and is appropriate for its entire duration.</p>
<h3 id="desired-skills-and-qualifications-for-this-position-include">Desired skills and qualifications for this position include</h3>
<ul>
<li>excellent programming abilities, with multiple programming languages preferred</li>
<li>experience in data management and synthesis</li>
<li>experience in working on clusters/supercomputers</li>
<li>experience in applying AI/ML techniques to biodiversity questions, more so when there was no existing consumer-ready solution</li>
<li>above average data visualization and communication skills</li>
<li>demonstrable expertise in training biologists in computational techniques</li>
<li>demonstrable commitment to the principles of open science</li>
<li>demonstrable expertise in reproducible research</li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that this is a broad list of requirements, and we do not expect
applicants to excel in all of these areas.</p>
<h3 id="application-materials">Application materials</h3>
<p>Applicants must submit, as a single PDF file, an application package containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cover letter (no more than 1 page) explaining their graduate, and if applicable post-doctoral, research; an overview of their teaching and mentoring activities; a statement of how this position will help them fulfill their career goals</li>
<li>a brief (no more than 1 page) statement of research interests, and how the applicant intends to use AI/ML in the context of biodiversity monitoring</li>
<li>a brief (no more than 1 page) statement on EDI, rich in specific actions and initiatives that the applicant have deployed or would deploy in their training and mentoring</li>
<li>a short resume following the NSF biosketch format: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/biosketch.jsp">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/biosketch.jsp</a></li>
<li>the applicant must not submit information related to grades, awards, prizes, etc, at this point in the process, nor mention altmetrics or impact factor</li>
</ul>
<p>The application document must be sent by email to
<code>timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca</code>, with the subject line “AI/ML QCBS
post-doc”; applications will be reviewed in real-time, and the selected
candidates will be invited for a remote interview, for a discussion with
Timothée Poisot (UdeM), Pierre-Luc Chagnon (UdeM/QCBS rep.), and Andy Gonzalez
(QCBS director / GEO BON co-chair elect).</p>
