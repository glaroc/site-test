        <p>We are organizing the fourth edition of our intensive class in data-driven
ecological synthesis, with support from the <a href="http://www.ciee-icee.com/">Canadian Institute of Ecology &amp;
Evolution</a>, and the NSERC BIOS2 CREATE program. You can <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gxFGFwYUhrQIQZGp2">apply
on-line</a>, or read the description below. Enrolment is limited to 24
students. The class will run from April 29 to May 5, at the Laurentians Field
Station, just outside of Montréal.</p>
<h1 id="goals-and-target-audience">Goals and target audience</h1>
<p>This week-long intensive class will give early-career ecologists the tools and
skills needed to interact with, manage, clean, and analyze data in a transparent
and reproducible way. We will specifically work on leveraging open data to
address new ecological questions at large spatial and temporal scales. You can
read more about the approach of computational ecology in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/14/150128">a preprint</a>
co-authored by students from the 2017 cohort.</p>
<p><strong>We expect that the attendees are able to turn the computer on, or willing to
learn how to do so. We will take care of the rest from here</strong>. A passing
knowledge of statistics and programming is a good thing, but eagerness
to learn is <strong>far</strong> more important than previous knowledge.</p>
<p>The class is open to all, and previous attendees included undergraduate and
graduate students, staff scientists, data analysts, and post-doctoral fellows.
We think it is particularly relevant for <em>PhD</em> students and post-doctoral
fellows.</p>
<p>Over the course of seven days, including learners-led projects to be continued
after the class, we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>good practices for data management</li>
<li>good practices in scientific computing</li>
<li>good practices for programming with data</li>
<li>useful statistical and mathematical tools</li>
<li>data cleaning and data analysis tools</li>
<li>notions of parallel computing for data processing</li>
<li>data visualization and presentation</li>
<li>ensuring reproducibility of analyses</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructors">Instructors</h2>
<p>The summer school will be led by Timothée Poisot (Université de Montréal), and
guest appearances by other local ecologists. One or two teaching assistants will
be here to facilitate the training.</p>
<p>Timothée is an assistant professor in Quantitative and Computational Ecology. He
is a certified Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor, serves on the
editorial board of Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution and PLOS Computational
Biology, and on the scientific board of Calcul Québec. His research focuses on
the spatio-temporal dynamics of species interactions, and the applications of
graph theory to a variety of ecological questions.</p>
<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>
<p>The summer school will take place at the <a href="http://www.sbl.umontreal.ca/index.html"><em>Station de Biologie des
Laurentides</em></a> (SBL), operated by the Université de Montréal. Situated in
the middle of a series of lakes, in the Laurentians, it is a very pleasant and
stimulating place to work and relax. The SBL is also a perfect example of an
emblematic Canadian biome, sitting at the transition zone between the urbanized
Greater Montréal area and the Canadian shield. It is known to have the best food
of all field stations in Canada.</p>
<h2 id="dates">Dates</h2>
<p>The summer school will take place from Apr. 29 to May 5, 2019. Selected
applicants will be notified by the second week of February at the latest.</p>
<h2 id="transport">Transport</h2>
<p>We will take care of the transportation from the Université de Montréal to the
field station on the morning on Apr. 29, and from the field station to the
Université de Montréal on the afternoon of May 5. Further details will be given
to the selected applicants.</p>
<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>Students from Québec universities can get 4 credits for this class through
CRÉPUQ (class code BIO6065). Please indicate if you want to claim these credits
when applying.</p>
<h1 id="program">Program</h1>
<p>All days will follow the same template: morning and afternoons are for
practice-based learning, and the evenings are shorter tutorials unless it&rsquo;s dark
enough for a bonfire. We emphasize and value peer instruction; all of the
attendees will bring unique skills and expertise, and it is common that one of
you will take on the role of instructor for a short session.</p>
