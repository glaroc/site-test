      <description>We are organizing the fourth edition of our intensive class in data-driven ecological synthesis, with support from the Canadian Institute of Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution, and the NSERC BIOS2 CREATE program. You can apply on-line, or read the description below. Enrolment is limited to 24 students. The class will run from April 29 to May 5, at the Laurentians Field Station, just outside of Montr√©al.
Goals and target audience This week-long intensive class will give early-career ecologists the tools and skills needed to interact with, manage, clean, and analyze data in a transparent and reproducible way.</description>
