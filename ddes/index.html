        <p>We are organizing the sixth edition of our intensive class in data-driven
ecological synthesis, with support from the NSERC BIOS² CREATE program and
the Fondation Courtois. Enrolment is limited to 30 students. The course will
run online only from the first week of May 2021, for six weeks, with three
meetings every week.</p>
<p>The class is free for students registered at a Québec university, and
the registration fees are (approx.) 800 CAD for other attendees. We will
automatically award a no-questions-asked grant equal to this amount to
attendees from under-represented minorities in STEM, members of Canada&rsquo;s
&ldquo;designated groups&rdquo; for EDI initiatives (women, people with disabilities,
Aboriginal peoples, and visible minorities), as well as members of the LGBTQIA+
community; we will also award several grants for the same amount to attendees
who can justify the need for it.</p>
<p>In a departure from the usual format of this course, this year’s cohort will
work collaboratively on a single project: predicting interactions between
viruses and mammals. This project will be led by and done in collaboration
with the <a href="https://www.viralemergence.org/">VERENA</a> consortium. We will put a specific emphasis on building up
skills related to machine learning (building recommender systems, ensemble
models) and the automation of synthesis of large amounts of data. A group
of researchers with expertise in data science, virology, public health, and
disease ecology, will be mentoring the different projects over the course
of the six weeks.</p>
<p>The application deadline is Dec. 31, 2020 - please apply on-line using
<a href="https://forms.gle/j1XVAtUkLwAc467e9">this link</a>.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-target-audience">Goals and target audience</h2>
<p>This intensive class will give early-career biologists the tools and
skills needed to interact with, manage, clean, and analyze data. We will put
a great deal of emphasis on the transparency and reproducibility of the data
transformation pipeline. We will specifically do so by working on leveraging
open data to address novel questions about ecological systems. You can read
more about the approach of computational ecology in a <a href="https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/IEE/article/view/13252">paper</a> co-authored
by students from the 2017 cohort.</p>
<p>We expect that the attendees can turn the computer on or be willing to
learn how to do so. We will take care of the rest from here. A passing
knowledge of statistics or mathematics and programming is a good thing,
but eagerness to learn is far more important than previous knowledge; we
always strive to have a balance between novice and advanced users. Due to
this year’s topic, we are particularly eager to receive applications from
learners with a background in infectious diseases, virology, public health,
species distribution modeling, or genomics.</p>
<p>The class is open to all, and previous attendees included undergraduate
and graduate students, staff scientists, data analysts, and post-doctoral
fellows. We think it is particularly relevant for Ph.D. students and
post-doctoral fellows.</p>
<p>The core skills we will cover during the class are</p>
<ul>
<li>best practices for data management</li>
<li>acceptable practices in scientific computing</li>
<li>good-enough practices for programming with data</li>
<li>useful statistical and mathematical tools</li>
<li>data cleaning and data analysis tools</li>
<li>parallel and distributed computing for data processing</li>
<li>data visualization and presentation</li>
<li>automation and reproducibility of analyses</li>
</ul>
<p>The class is extremely participatory, where a lot of training modules are
delivered based on the learners’ needs. Some of the modules delivered
over the last years included Bayesian statistics, code optimization, and
introduction to GIS.</p>

<h3 id="instructors">Instructors</h3>
<p>The summer school will be led by Timothée Poisot and will include guest
appearances by other investigators from the VERENA consortium.</p>
<p>Timothée is a researcher at the Québec Center for Biodiversity Sciences
and an associate professor in Quantitative and Computational Ecology at the
Université de Montréal. He is a certified Software Carpentry and Data
Carpentry instructor, serves on the editorial board of Ecology Letters,
Methods in Ecology &amp; Evolution and PLOS Computational Biology, and on
the scientific board of Calcul Québec and the Canadian Institute for
Ecology &amp; Evolution. He contributes to the artificial intelligence branch
of the activities of the GEO BON secretariat. His research focuses on the
spatio-temporal dynamics of species interactions and the applications of
graph theory to a variety of ecological questions.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
<p>Students from Québec universities can get four credits for this class
through CRÉPUQ (class code BIO6065). Please indicate if you want to claim
these credits when applying. If you are registered to a non-Québécois
university, you can be issued a letter of participation with the details of
the course content to claim credits in your own institution.</p>
